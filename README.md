# ip2cidr

ip2cidr was created on the belief that it will be useful for the community and it would be a great contribution to the opensource world to easily perform the conversion of IP Address Ranges to IP CIDR blocks.
Since it has proven to be fairly useful to me and my colleagues, we have decided to share the code with the Ruby community.

You can contact us if there is something that we could add to make your life easier.
